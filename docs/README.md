## 🚀 What Does Flextensions Do?

### [🧑‍🏫 For Course Staff](/flextensions/instructors/):
- View and manage extensions requests for all assignments in your course.
- Grant extensions to students with a few clicks.
- Monitor extension usage across your course.
- Automate approving extension requests and email sending

### [🎓 For Students](/flextensions/students/):
- View all your granted extensions in one place.
- See how long your extension lasts and when the new due date is.
- Stay informed and organized without checking multiple systems.

## 🔧 How It Works

Flextensions connects directly with bCourses (Canvas) and imports your assignments. The interface is intuitive and role-based—course staff can grant and manage, while students can view.
