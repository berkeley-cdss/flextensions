### Writing Custom Descriptions
You can also provide a **Custom Description** for the following sections:
- **Why do you need this extension?**
- **Additional Documentation**
The custom descriptions are shown directly on the form and help clarify what kind of response is expected. For example, you may want to include a note like:
>‚ÄúPlease do not include any personal health or disability related details. If you have >questions, contact the course staff before submitting.‚Äù
This helps ensure students provide appropriate and relevant information while maintaining privacy.
### Creating Custom Questions
Instructors may define up to two additional custom questions (labeled Additional Question 1 and Additional Question 2). Each question includes:
- A **Title** field, which acts as the prompt shown to students.
- A **Description** field, which provides more context or instructions for the question.
These fields are optional and allow for flexibility in gathering course-specific information (e.g., "What steps have you already taken to complete the assignment?" or "Have you communicated with your TA?").
### Setting Question Display
Each section (including the custom questions and additional documentation) can be shown or hidden using the Display dropdown. The available options are:
- *Hidden*- The section will not appear on the student form.
- *(Other options like "Required" or "Optional" may be available depending on the implementation.)*

After configuring your custom questions and visibility settings, click the **Update** button at the bottom of the page to save your changes.
